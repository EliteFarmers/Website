			<h2 class="text-2xl my-8">What is Farming Weight?</h2>
			<p class="text-lg my-4">
				Farming Weight is a number that essentially represents how long and how efficient a player has been
				farming. It is calculated by using a different formula for each crop that a player has farmed, and then
				adding them all together. Farming XP is not a factor in this calculation outside of one time bonus
				weight amounts. This is to ensure that players who farm using rabbit or who farm higher XP crops don't
				have an unfair advantage over players who farm using other methods.

			<h2 class="text-2xl my-8">Farming Weight Per Crop</h2>
			<p class="text-lg my-4">
				Each crop has a different weight. The weight of a crop is determined by the theoretical maximum amount
				of crops that can be farmed in the same timespan. The following table shows the amount of each crop
				needed to increase your farming weight by 1.
			</p>
			<CropTable />
			<p class="text-sm mt-4 mb-2">
				Base Drops Per Break refers to the average amount of drops you get from breaking a crop without any
				buffs. Sugar Cane and Cactus actually have a base drop of 1 per block, but because you can break 2
				blocks at once, 2 is noted here. Full calculation breakdowns will be added in the future.
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm">
				* Mushroom weight is calculated dynamically because of the Mooshroom Cow pet. Because Cactus and Sugar
				Cane are both 2 blocks per break, the cow's perk gives you twice the normal rate of mushroom drops than
				from other crops. To counter this, you get half the weight from mushrooms for the ratio of Cactus and
				Sugar Cane farmed out of the total weight, and the remainder is calculated normally.

			<p class="text-lg my-4">
				There are a few sources of bonus weight that can be obtained. These are not intended to be a significant
				source of weight, but rather a small bonus to help players who are just starting out. As well as a fun
				way to get a little extra weight for completing different farming content in the game.
