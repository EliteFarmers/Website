# Privacy Policy

<sub>Last updated: <strong>October 19, 2025</strong></sub>

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Service. By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## The Basics

- **Service**: This includes our website (`elitebot.dev`), our API (`api.elitebot.dev`), and our Discord application ("Elite Discord Bot").
- **Personal Data**: Information that can be used to identify you, like your Discord account details.
- **Public Data**: Information that is publicly visible by design, such as your Minecraft player data or linked accounts.
- **Usage Data**: Anonymous data collected automatically about how the Service is used.

## What Information We Collect

We only collect the information necessary to provide and improve our Service.

### 1. Information from Your Discord Account

When you log in to our Service using Discord, we receive and store limited information from your account. This is essential for the Service to function.

- **Basic Profile Information**: We store your Discord User ID, username, and other basic account information. We use this to create and manage your account, display your profile, and associate your settings with you. We do **not** receive or store your email address or other sensitive data from Discord.
- **Your Server List**: To allow you to manage the bot, our website requests a list of the Discord servers you are in. This data is used to display servers where you have administrative permissions so you can configure settings.

### 2. Information You Provide Directly

- **Linked Minecraft Account(s)**: You can optionally link your Minecraft account(s) to the Service. We store this link to provide game-related features.
- **Configuration Settings**: We save any settings you configure on the website to customize your experience.

### 3. Information from Third-Party Services

- **Discord Purchases**: If you subscribe to paid features or make other purchases through Discord, Discord provides us with non-identifiable transaction data so we can grant you benefits. We do **not** receive your payment details.
- **Public Game Data**: Our Service retrieves publicly available data about your Minecraft account from third-party services like the Hypixel API and Mojang APIs.

### 4. Automatically Collected Usage Data

- **Service Analytics**: We collect anonymous data about how you interact with our Service (e.g., which features are used most). This helps us improve the user experience.
- **Google Analytics**: We use Google Analytics to help us analyze website traffic. If you provide consent through our cookie banner, we may also enable Google Signals. This feature enhances our analytics by associating your visit information with your Google account, if you are signed-in and have consented to Ads Personalization on Google.<br/><br/>This provides us with aggregated and anonymized demographic data (like age, gender) and interest data, which helps us better understand our users. This data is always aggregated and we cannot see information about individual users. You can access and manage this data at any time through Google's [My Ad Center](https://myadcenter.google.com/).

## Cookies and Similar Technologies

We use cookies to help our Service function and to understand how you use it.

### How We Use Cookies

We use the following types of cookies:

- **Essential Cookies**: These are necessary for the website to function properly. They handle tasks like keeping you logged in (session management) and remembering your preferences. You cannot opt out of these cookies as the website will not work correctly without them.
- **Analytics Cookies**: We use these cookies to understand how users interact with our Service. We use Google Analytics, which helps us collect anonymous data like which pages are most popular and how long visitors stay on our site. This information helps us improve the Service for everyone.

### How to Control Cookies

Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can set your browser to block or delete cookies, but be aware that if you block our essential cookies, parts of our Service may not work.

- **Business Transfers**: If we are involved in a merger or acquisition, your data may be transferred. We will notify you before this happens.
- **With Advertising Partners**: If you consent to advertising cookies, we may use data collected through services like Google Signals to enable remarketing, which means you might see ads for our Service on other websites. In the future, we may partner with other third-party ad networks that use similar technologies. Your consent is always required, and you can manage your preferences through our cookie banner and your Google account settings.

## Data Security, Retention and International Transfer
