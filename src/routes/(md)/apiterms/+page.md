# Elite API Terms of Service

[Elite API Documentation](https://api.elitebot.dev)

## Usage Restrictions

- Adhere to the [Terms of Service](/terms), [Privacy Policy](/privacy), and [Hypixel's Developer Policies](https://developer.hypixel.net/policies/)

- Do not use the API for commercial purposes, any feature that
  uses the API should be free for all users.

- This API does not serve as a Hypixel API proxy. If your goal
  when using this API is to get Hypixel data, then you're not allowed to use it. This API is meant
  to be used for those looking to integrate farming weight into their own projects, or using
  endpoints that don't return player data.

- For any use of the API, you must credit "[`https://elitebot.dev/`](https://elitebot.dev)"
  on your website or application with a clear and clickable link present on every page/display
  that uses the API. If this is not possible, you can [contact us](/contact) to discuss acceptable credit.

- API access may be revoked at any time for any reason.

- Respect the rate limits. If you need more requests, you
  shouldn't be using the API. You're welcome to host your own
  instance of the API if you need morerequests, but otherwise use Hypixel's API.

- The API should never be used purely as a Mojang API proxy. If
  you need to get a player's UUID, use the Mojang API.

- Do not use the API in a public project without permission from Us.
  If you want to use the API in a public project, [contact us](/contact).

## Reporting Violations

Feel free to report violations to us on the [contact page](/contact).

## Other Options

If these restrictions are too much for you, you're free to host your own instance of the API!
