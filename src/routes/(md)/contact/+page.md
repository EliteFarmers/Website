# Contact Us

How and when to reach out!

## Report Bugs / Make Suggestions

Please report any bugs or make suggestions on the [support Discord server](/support). You may also use the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EliteFarmers/Website) to report bugs, but the Discord server is preferred.

## Appeal a ban on The Elite Skyblock Farmers

This is not the place to appeal a ban on the Elite Farmers server. The Elite Skyblock Farmers has no
ban appeal system at this time, and trying to contact us about a ban will not result in any action
being taken.

## Questions about farming or Hypixel

You can ask questions about farming or Hypixel in the [community Discord server](/discord). Do not contact us directly with questions like these.

## Email Contact

For business or legal inquiries, please email [contact@elitebot.dev](mailto:contact@elitebot.dev).
Any other inquiries may be ignored, and should instead be directed to the [support Discord server](/support).
