## Text formatting

Use markdown to format your text. You can use **bold**, _italic_, and `code` formatting.
Also \`\`\`code blocks\`\`\` are supported. You can put a `\` to escape special characters.

```ts
// Code blocks can be used for longer code snippets.
export const siteConfig = defineSiteConfig({
	name: 'Skyblock Repo',
	url: 'https://skyblockrepo.com',
	description: 'Skyblock Repo is a comprehensive resource for Skyblock developers!',
	author: 'Skyblock Repo',
	keywords: ['skyblock', 'skyblockrepo', 'repository', 'development', 'hypixel'],
});
```
